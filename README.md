# coffee-tracker

Do you get confused about how awesome your coffee beans are? I do. That's why I built this app. Now I can keep track of what I'm drinking and how it tasted and you can too! Here's how to get started:

# installation

Install gems 

``` bundle install ```

Start the server by going to the /backend directory and running:

``` rails s ```

Open index.html in /frontend using your favourite browser, and you're away!

Happy coffee drinking!
